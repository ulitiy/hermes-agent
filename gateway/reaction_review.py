"""Weekly review of Telegram reactions placed on Hermes messages.

This module turns the raw ``telegram_reaction_events`` rows (captured by the
Telegram adapter's ``MessageReactionHandler`` — see
``gateway/platforms/telegram.py``) into a human-readable feedback digest that
asks Sasha targeted follow-ups, e.g. "you put 💩 here — what went wrong?" or
"you put ❤️ here — what was useful?".

It is deliberately a plain, dependency-light module so it can be:
  * imported by the ``scripts/reaction_digest.py`` CLI (cron data-collection),
  * unit-tested directly against a temp SessionDB, and
  * reused from a gateway slash command or an agent tool later.

Privacy: the digest only surfaces the assistant's own output snippet (already
truncated at capture time) plus the emoji + reactor name. No inbound user text
and no raw Telegram payloads are stored or rendered.
